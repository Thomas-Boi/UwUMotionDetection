This project aims to explore the application of motion detection in browser app, either for productive goals or for entertainment. For this project, the productive app is a 3D interactor that users can use to translate, rotate and scale a 3D object.

Prerequisite:
- A computer with a camera that's detectable by your browser
- A Google Chrome browser (or any Chromium browser) for the best experience
- A right-handed person (left-handed support will come in the future)

How to use:
- Navigate to this [website](https://thomas-boi.github.io/UwUMotionDetection/).
- Accept the browser's request for camera access
- Look at the instruction as you wait for the app to load. In case you need it, here are the movements:
  - Grab and Drag: Translate
  - Index finger up (like holding the number One) and move side-to-side: Rotate around Y axis
  - Index finger straight out and point to the left (like swiping upward on a phone): Rotate around X axis
  - Thumbs up and move side-to-side: Scale
  - L-Shape (like imagining taking a picture): Reset to original position, rotation, and scale
- Once the app finishes loading, hold out a your hand like a star fish or number five to start the app.
- Interact with the cube to your heart's content
